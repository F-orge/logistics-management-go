In today’s technological age, industries are struggling to meet customer demands
because of outdated and lousy systems; logistic industries are no different.
Whether it is managing orders, tracking deliveries, or attracting new clients,
logistics businesses need effective systems to stay competitive and relevant.
Without a proper system in place, it becomes difficult to manage operations
smoothly and grow the customer base.

This project focuses on developing an all-in-one system for ETMAR Logistics that
will not only enhance their daily operations but also help them better serve and
attract more customers and potentially grow their company. By addressing the
company’s outdated processes and improving its marketing capabilities, this new
system aims to streamline their workflow and boost overall business efficiency.

ETMAR Logistics began by providing shipping services for balikbayan boxes, which
allowed Filipinos living abroad to send packages back home. Over time, the
company shifted its focus to exporting food products, including both perishable
and non-perishable items. This shift has allowed ETMAR to help the Philippines
export local groceries and Filipino delicacies to international markets. ETMAR
operates two branches: one in Dublin, Ireland, which serves the European Union,
and another in the Philippines, which handles global exports. Although they are
the same company, they have different owners and have different work functions,
but in the end, they have the same goal of serving their customers and exporting
local products worldwide.

ETMAR specializes in food exports, which require careful planning and precise
logistics management. For perishable goods, timing is key to ensuring freshness;
they make sure to prioritize perishable goods since they ship them through
airway cargo to different countries. While non-perishable goods often take
longer shipping routes, which is a hassle because of traffic, hence the reason
they stopped using trucks and used packaging agencies like “Lalamove” or other
different apps used for transferring goods. The Dublin branch serves the
European Union market, while the Philippine branch manages global deliveries
using air freight and local couriers.

These procedures make it essential to maintain accurate records of inventory,
shipment schedules, and customer orders. However, without a centralized system
to manage these functions, ensuring smooth and efficient operations can become a
significant challenge.

Background of the Problem

ETMAR International Logistics Corporation faces several critical operational
challenges in their current business setup. The company's reliance on online
office suites for managing and collaborating on documents presents limitations
as these tools are designed for general use rather than specialized logistics
operations. (see Appendix A: Interview Transcripts: Question 11, pg. 50). Their
document sharing process through links creates potential issues with version
control and poses security risks. The lack of proper access control mechanisms
makes it difficult to manage who can view and edit sensitive information,
especially during peak seasons when temporary staff are brought in to handle
increased workload. (see Appendix A: Interview Transcripts: Question 28, pg.
55).

ETMAR's product reservation capabilities have been severely limited since their
previous system was discontinued by the original developers. ETMAR has not fully
capitalized on digital marketing platforms, making it difficult to attract new
clients and expand its market. (see Appendix A: Interview Transcripts: Question
15 & 25, pg. 53 & 55). Currently, they rely on Facebook advertisements and Meta
Business Manager to reach potential customers and use email communications and
Facebook messenger for customer interactions and order updates. One of the most
significant issues is the company’s limited marketing reach. This includes
manually sending shipment status updates and cargo tracking reference numbers
from airline portals to customers. (see Appendix A: Interview Transcripts:
Question 17, pg. 53). The manual nature of these processes hinders their ability
to scale the business and effectively reach international buyers without
incurring substantial advertising expenses.

The company's current access control situation poses significant risks to data
integrity and security. With various employees handling different aspects of
inventory and operations, the lack of advanced access control features in their
Google Sheets-based system makes it challenging to prevent unauthorized access
and maintain data consistency. This problem arises and is made worse when
temporary staff are brought in during peak periods, as there is no systematic
way to restrict access to sensitive information or track who makes changes to
important data. The inability to properly define and enforce user roles and
permissions creates vulnerability in their operations and puts their data
security at risk. (see Appendix A: Interview Transcripts: Question 28, pg. 55).

According to Miss Maribeth, Managing Director of ETMAR Logistics, ETMAR’s
current management systems are inefficient. (see Appendix A: Interview
Transcripts: Question 29, pg. 55). There is no unified system for tracking
inventory, processing orders, or managing customer data. This leads to manual
processes that take more time and are prone to errors, resulting in delays and
communication issues. Moreover, ETMAR lacks an automated pricing system, which
makes generating quotes based on distance and product type a slow process. The
absence of reliable order tracking also causes confusion for both staff and
customers, leading to uncertainty about shipment statuses.

Collaborative Document Management Limitations in Inventory Management Operations
The ETMAR International Logistics Corporation uses online office suites such as
Google Sheets and Google Docs for managing and collaborating on their documents.
These online office suites are for general, not custom-made, and have certain
limitations. (see Appendix A: Interview Transcripts: Question 11, pg. 50). When
managing data, they communicate with each other using document links, which
could produce potential challenges regarding version control, security risks,
and access control. (see Appendix A: Interview Transcripts: Question 11, pg.
50). During peak seasons, workloads are high that additional manpower is needed
and sometimes they hire part-time to accommodate. (see Appendix A: Interview
Transcripts: Question 28, pg. 55) Since they intend to expand their business
operations, the managing director of the logistics company and its account
executive	 wanted a cloud-based management system that will enable them to
effortlessly collaborate more than online office suites can provide. (see
Appendix A: Interview Transcripts: Question 9, pg. 50)

Inefficient and Manual Product Reservation and Customer Notification Process
Currently, ETMAR International Logistics Corporation has no dedicated system in
place for handling product reservations. (see Appendix A: Interview Transcripts:
Question 8, pg. 50). The previous system was taken down by the original
developers, leaving the company with limited options for promoting its service
and communicating with customers. At present, ETMAR relies on Facebook ads to
reach potential buyers and uses email to communicate with customers on using
their service. Email is also used to update customers about the status of their
shipments, including reference numbers provided by airline portals for cargo
tracking. (see Appendix A: Interview Transcripts: Question 26, pg. 55). This
manual process presents challenges in scaling the business and reaching
international buyers efficiently, especially as ETMAR plans to expand without
incurring high advertising costs. (see Appendix A: Interview Transcripts:
Question 9, pg. 50).

Inefficient Manual Warehouse Capacity Monitoring ETMAR International Logistics
Corporation currently faces challenges in maintaining accurate and up-to-date
inventory records due to its reliance on manual processes and general-purpose
tools like Google Sheets. (see Appendix A: Interview Transcripts: Question 11,
pg. 50). This approach often leads to inconsistencies, errors, and delays in
updating inventory data. The lack of inventory management system makes it
challenging to monitor stock levels accurately. The company requires a more
efficient way to manage inventory and track stock movements in real-time,
especially during peak seasons when the risk of inventory-related issues
increases significantly.

Inadequate Access Control and Data Security Management System ETMAR
International Logistics Corporation currently manages its inventory data using
general-purpose tools like Google Sheets, which lack advanced access control
features. (see Appendix A: Interview Transcripts: Question 11, pg. 50). This
puts the company at risk of unauthorized access and data changes and makes it
hard to keep information consistent. With different employees handling different
various and inventory categories, it becomes challenging to control who can
view, edit, or manage specific data. (see Appendix A: Interview Transcripts:
Question 28, pg. 55). This problem gets worse when they bring in temporary staff
during busy periods. The company needs a system that can set clear rules and
permissions for each user, making sure employees can only access the information
they need for their job. This would help ETMAR protect their data, prevent
mistakes, and make their operations more secure and efficient.

Overview of the current state of the technology

In the logistics industry, there is a growing need for centralized, streamlined
systems to enhance operational efficiency and manage increasing customer
demands. Many logistics companies, like ETMAR Logistics, continue to face
challenges related to outdated systems that limit their ability to manage
complex operations effectively. Historically, general-purpose tools such as
Google Sheets and Docs have been widely adopted due to their accessibility and
ease of use. However, these tools are not optimized for specific logistics
functions, resulting in limitations in version control, security, access
management, and collaboration.

The absence of dedicated inventory management and reservation systems within
ETMAR Logistics has created significant challenges. Without real-time order
tracking and automated pricing, the company relies heavily on manual processes,
which are prone to

errors and time delays. The company’s dependency on manual updates through
document links for inventory tracking creates inconsistencies. This approach not
only affects operational efficiency but also compromises customer satisfaction
due to delays in fulfilling orders.

Customer Acquisition

ETMAR finds customers primarily through social media platforms like Facebook and
traditional marketing methods. They communicate with potential clients via
Facebook messages to introduce their products and services.

Client Communication

Once contact is established, ETMAR continues communication through Facebook or
transitions to emails and phone calls for more detailed discussions. They engage
with the client to understand their specific needs and product interests.

Quotation and Pricing

Pricing details are not listed on the website or social media platforms. After
understanding the client's requirements, ETMAR sends a detailed email directly
to the client outlining the pricing and terms. This personalized approach allows
for customized quotations but depends heavily on manual effort.

Sourcing and Supplier Coordination

Upon receiving an order, ETMAR connects with local suppliers to source the
required products. Acting as an accredited exporter, they coordinate between the
suppliers and the client to ensure that the products meet the client's
specifications.

Inventory Management

Inventory levels are tracked manually using physical record books. This method
lacks real-time updates and increases the risk of discrepancies, particularly
challenging when handling perishable goods that require timely management.

Documentation Preparation

ETMAR prepares shipment documentation, including labels, customs forms, and
client details, using semi-automated templates. While templates streamline the
process to some extent, manual entry is still required, which can lead to errors
and delays.

Transportation Arrangements

The company arranges the shipment of goods using their own trucks, ships, or
primarily airplanes for faster delivery of perishables. Due to traffic
congestion, they often utilize third-party services like Lalamove for local
deliveries, as motorcycles can navigate city traffic more efficiently than
trucks.

Shipment Tracking

Shipments are tracked through airline websites using reference numbers provided
by the carriers. ETMAR does not have an integrated tracking system, so they rely
on these external portals. This approach means that if there is no internet
access, tracking capabilities are hindered.

Customer Notifications

ETMAR receives shipment status updates via email notifications. They then
manually inform clients about the status of their orders through emails or
calls. Clients do not have direct access to real-time tracking information
through ETMAR's systems.

Order Fulfillment Challenges

Managing multiple orders, especially during peak seasons like the "ber" months
(September to December), poses significant challenges. Each client is handled by
a different employee, and the lack of automation leads to increased workload and
potential slowdowns. Handling perishable items adds urgency, and without
automated systems, there's a higher risk of inefficiencies.

Data Management and Oversight

Important data such as payments and employee work hours are tracked manually.
There's no centralized system to monitor financial transactions or employee
productivity, making auditing and oversight difficult.

Objectives of the study

To address these issues, the proposed system for ETMAR Logistics will
incorporate QR code-based tracking, automated pricing, real-time inventory
updates, and a role-based access control mechanism. These innovations aim to
streamline ETMAR's operations and enhance security by reducing manual
intervention, minimizing errors, and enabling better data management. This
modernized system will allow ETMAR to improve its service delivery, support
expansion efforts, and remain competitive in an increasingly digital market. The
proposed solution intends to not only meet ETMAR’s current needs but also
provide a scalable infrastructure that can accommodate future growth and adapt
to industry advancements.

The system is centralized for the entire company, making it easier to
communicate and share data, while also incorporating QR codes based on mobile
web application for efficient tracking for shipments, a simple user-friendly
interface, and an integrated website with account management systems for both
staff and customers.

The main objective of this study is to develop a centralized and efficient
Online Inventory and Reservation Management System for ETMAR Logistics that will
improve their operational efficiency, streamline processes, and enhance
inventory accuracy, ultimately supporting the company’s expansion goals.

The specific objectives of this study are as follows:

To design and develop an Online Inventory Management System that will improve
operational efficiency and inventory accuracy by centralizing and automating
inventory tracking, reducing manual errors, improving data consistency, and
providing a more robust solution than general-purpose tools like Google Sheets
and Docs.

To design and develop an Online Reservation and Delivery Tracking System that
allows customers to reserve products online, check order status, and receive
notifications for shipment and delivery updates, thereby enhancing customer
engagement, improving satisfaction, and reducing the reliance on Facebook
messenger and email when tracking shipments.

To design and develop a QR Code scanning system that optimizes the inventory
management process by enabling real-time tracking of shipment movements, and
ensures accurate and up-to-date inventory records, especially during peak
seasons.

To design and implement a Role-Based Access Control System within the Online
Inventory Management System that enhances security, ensures data integrity,
restricts unauthorized access to sensitive information, and properly defines and
enforces user roles and permissions, particularly when temporary staff are
employed during busy periods. (see Appendix A: Interview Transcripts: Question
28, pg. 55)

These objectives directly address the problems identified in the statement of
the problem, offering specific solutions in the same order to improve ETMAR
Logistics' operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, data security, and
support their expansion efforts.

Scope and limitations of the study

This study aims to design and implement a cloud-based inventory and customer
management system for ETMAR Logistics. Based on the interview that the
proponents have conducted with ETMAR Logistics, there needs to create an
integrated system for inventory management, customer management, order tracking.
Real-time inventory visibility via QR code scanning and an intuitive user
interface that both employees and consumers can use are some of the key
features. By establishing an online presence for service promotion and consumer
involvement, the technology will help improve ETMAR's marketing efforts
alongside Facebook advertisements and email. This system is intended for ETMAR
employees and its customers, who will gain from more effective internal
operations, and customers, who will enjoy simplified ordering and tracking
procedures. This study spans the full system development lifecycle, from initial
analysis and design to testing and deployment, ensuring a comprehensive approach
to addressing ETMAR’s operational needs, the proponents use the interview
questions as the main gathering instrument to conduct this study.
